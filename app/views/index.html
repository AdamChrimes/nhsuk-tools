	<h1>Mood self-assessment quiz</h1>
	<p>When it comes to emotions, it can sometimes be hard to recognise or admit that we're not feeling 100%.
	<p>If you’re 16 or over, this mood self-assessment can:
	<ul>
		<li>help you better understand how you've been feeling over the last 2 weeks</li>
		<li>point you in the right direction for helpful advice and information</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It’s not meant to replace an appointment with a GP. If you’re struggling, it’s best to speak to someone.</p>
	<p>If you’re under 16, the <a href="https://youngminds.org.uk/">Young Minds website</a> can offer help and support for young people’s mental health.</p>
	{{ actionLink({
